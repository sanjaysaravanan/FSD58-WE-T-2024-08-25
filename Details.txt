0. module import hoisting behavior

1. Node JS npm project, so we can install external packages
    1. Create a project for the backend
    2. npm install <package-name>

1.1 Create file with name as the iso datetime & contents as the timestamp

2. HTTP Server:

    http --> protocol used to serve files or data via network

    basic server creation using http create server

    Disadvantages:
      http: does not provide wide variety of function to support operations like,

        1. body parsing
        2. changing http methods
        3. handling middlewares
        4. proper routing logic is not possible

      We need to manually handle it with a lots of codes

2.1 POST-Man
    Browser by default has some restrictions for doing REST API calls

    Tool used to access different API Methods like below,
      1. GET
      2. POST
      3. PUT
      4. DELETE

3. Express:
    APIs using express -
    why express external module:
        basic server creation is possible in normal nodejs that involves lot of code with lots of built-in packages
    
        Express combines everything and puts together in simple terms
          web framework http server applcation which lets us create APIs in fast and simple ways

      /students - CRUD (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
        store in local memory
        GET - get all the students in the memory
        POST - Create a new student in the memory
        DELETE - Delete a student in the memory

    Router:
      express.Router(); // sample instance of the server

4. CRUD Operations with APIs
   CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

5. URL Params:
    Path Params: /:id

        id or name is the path variable/param
      request.params

      param is *id*
    
    Query Params: comes after question mark
      request.query
      /todos?deleteId=100
      param is *deleteId*

6. Request is an object with pre-defined key<->value pairs & methods/functions

    express request object is different or customized depending on the requirements
    used to operate on top of the request in-coming

    Eg: request.body gives the payload, 
    
    Below are created by expressjs,
      req.params['<param-name>'] gives the path param. request.query will give the query param

    reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request

7. Resposne:
    response is an object with pre-defined key<->value pairs & methods
    used to operate on top of the response out-going

    Express Created funcs,
      res.send(); res.status(), res.json()

8. Deploying a nodejs application using render.com
      1. Publish codes to Github
      2. Log in or Sign-Up with Github on render.com
      3. New Web Service
      4. Choose Repo & connect
      5. Configure proper cmds
          1. build cmd ---> npm install
          2. Start Command ---> whatever the script that You want to run (node express-server.js)
      6. Deploy ( Watch out for any errors in the deployment process)

Tasks:

  Day 33:

    File System Task:
      https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_u6azHv7AQHse45GGcrCRe78liwv90S5aHwBR7tBP0/edit

  Day 34: 

    Nodejs hall booking api task using local memory variable as we did today,
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwPQ2LbHtMZajA_GIZfR-Ko2MFueoT82AmfHTK9V-hM/edit

    Logic: keep the below variables in a single file and export them as data for api logic,
    rooms = [], bookings = [], customers = []

    Related Entities:
      /rooms ( CRUD )
      /bookings ( CRUD )
      /customers ( CRUD )

    Send the responses appropriately using if else blocks

    How to relate the data together, try the entity relation, also use the array methods
